       <p id="gradient">
         The point of purchase displays within this project were completed while working for different design companies. The objective of working on these projects, was to read creative briefs from customers and create a display that met their specific needs. These projects allowed me to collaborate with the design teams and create structures and/or graphics that met customers desires. I worked with die lines, placed customer supplied graphics and came up with creative original designs. Projects usually started as sketches, then turned in to renderings with and without products.
