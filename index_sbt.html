        <h1>Blue Devils Softball</h1>


       <p id="gradient">
           The Blue Devil Softball shirt was a design that I created for my softball team at UW-Stout. We were going on our annual spring break trip where we would play 12 games, and be watched by fans,friends and family. The goal of the shirt was to create a design that followed Stouts athletic branding guidelines but was specific to the trip. I created the design, pitched it to our coaches and got it approved by the department. It was a good experience to create a design that the team, coaches,fans,family and friends would all wear during the trip and after. It was really rewarding to look up from the field and see my design everywhere I looked.
